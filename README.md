## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://elaborate-snickerdoodle-11b06c.netlify.app/)

_"Treasures of the ages, on sale now!"_ - Hermit Shopkeeper

Mythic Item Shop is a dynamic e-commerce application that mimics the UI/UX of a real online shopping portal. The project was built in React and features a theme designed around the online video game League of Legends (one of my personal favorites). Explore the artifacts of Runeterra by purchasing Mythic-level items from the game, complete with in-game data such as item stats and descriptions. Note: The checkout section of this project has not yet been implemented.
